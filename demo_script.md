## Q&A Preparation (Common Questions)

### Technical Questions
**Q: "What about security and fraud prevention?"**
A: Dynamic QR codes expire in 5 minutes, single-use only, with backend validation. Much more secure than traditional coupon systems.

**Q: "What if technology fails?"**  
A: Manual backup codes available, plus simple phone number verification system as fallback.

### Business Questions
**Q: "How do we acquire partners?"**
A: Start with existing club supplier relationships, then expand to member-recommended businesses. Built-in customer base is attractive to partners.

**Q: "What's our liability?"**
A: Platform facilitates discounts only - no payment processing or inventory management. Partners handle their own customer service and fulfillment.

### Financial Questions
**Q: "What are ongoing costs?"**
A: Hosting: $50/month, maintenance: 5 hours/month, support: minimal with self-service design.

**Q: "How do we measure success?"**
A: Member engagement rates, partner retention, transaction volume growth, and direct revenue from transaction fees.

### Strategic Questions
**Q: "Could other clubs copy this?"**
A: Yes, but our first-mover advantage and existing community relationships create natural barriers to entry.

**Q: "What if it doesn't work?"**
A: Low-risk investment with clear success metrics. Can pivot to different business model or discontinue with minimal loss.
